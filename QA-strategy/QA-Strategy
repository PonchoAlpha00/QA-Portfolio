# üõ†Ô∏è QA Strategy Document

## üìå **Objective:**
Define the **Quality Assurance (QA) strategy** to ensure software quality, reliability, and performance through structured testing methodologies.

---

## **1. QA Scope**
- **Functional Testing**: Verify that the system meets business requirements.
- **API Testing**: Ensure APIs work as expected and are secure.
- **Performance Testing**: Assess system response time, stability, and scalability.
- **Security Testing**: Identify vulnerabilities and enforce access controls.
- **ETL Testing**: Validate data extraction, transformation, and loading accuracy.
- **Automation Testing**: Improve efficiency with automated test scripts.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Validate that the system meets user expectations.

## **2. Test Approach**

### **2.1 Testing Levels**
| Level | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Validate individual components in isolation. |
| **Integration Testing** | Ensure modules work together as expected. |
| **System Testing** | Validate end-to-end business processes. |
| **Regression Testing** | Retest to confirm no breakages after changes. |
| **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | End-user validation before release. |

### **2.2 Testing Types**
| Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Manual Testing** | Execute test cases manually for validation. |
| **Automated Testing** | Use scripts to automate repetitive test scenarios. |
| **Performance Testing** | Assess system behavior under load. |
| **Security Testing** | Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. |
| **ETL Testing** | Validate data integrity in extraction, transformation, and loading. |

## **3. Test Plan & Execution**

### **3.1 Test Case Design**
- Follow a structured **test case template**.
- Define **preconditions, steps, expected results, and postconditions**.
- Ensure **traceability** to requirements.

### **3.2 Defect Management**
- Report bugs using a standardized **bug report template**.
- Track defects in **Jira, Azure DevOps, or TestRail**.
- Categorize defects based on **severity and priority**.

### **3.3 Test Execution Process**
| Stage | Activity |
|--------|-------------|
| **Planning** | Identify test scope, test types, and timelines. |
| **Design** | Create test cases, scripts, and data sets. |
| **Execution** | Run manual/automated tests and log defects. |
| **Reporting** | Share test results, defect trends, and coverage metrics. |
| **Closure** | Ensure all critical defects are resolved before release. |

---

## **4. Tools & Technologies**
| Category | Tool |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Test Case Management** | TestRail, Xray, Zephyr |
| **Bug Tracking** | Jira, Azure DevOps |
| **Automation Framework** | Selenium, Playwright, Postman |
| **Performance Testing** | JMeter, Gatling |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Jenkins, GitHub Actions |
| **ETL Testing** | SQL queries, Talend |

---

## **5. Quality Metrics & Reporting**

### **5.1 Key Metrics**
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Test Coverage** | % of test cases covering requirements. |
| **Defect Density** | Number of defects per test execution. |
| **Test Execution Rate** | % of planned tests executed. |
| **Defect Turnaround Time** | Average time to fix reported defects. |

### **5.2 Reporting Cadence**
- **Daily:** Test execution status updates.
- **Weekly:** Defect trend reports.
- **End of Sprint:** Test summary and recommendations.

---

## **6. Risk Management**
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tight Deadlines** | Prioritize critical test cases. |
| **Unstable Test Environment** | Use mock data and backup servers. |
| **High Defect Rate** | Implement early defect detection in CI/CD pipeline. |

---

## **7. Conclusion**
- The **QA strategy ensures** high-quality software releases.
- **Continuous improvement** is key‚Äîmonitor metrics and optimize testing.
- Collaboration between **QA, Development, and Business Teams** is essential.

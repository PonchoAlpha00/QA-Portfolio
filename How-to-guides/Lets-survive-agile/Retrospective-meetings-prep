# üìù How to Prepare for a Retrospective Meeting

## üìå **Objective:**
A **Retrospective Meeting** is a structured discussion held at the end of a sprint or project phase to reflect on successes, challenges, and areas for improvement. This document outlines how to **prepare for a productive retrospective meeting**.

---

## **1. Define the Meeting Goals**
Before the meeting, establish:
- **What are the key objectives?** (e.g., identify improvements, celebrate wins, address blockers).
- **Who should attend?** (Scrum Master, Developers, QA, Product Owners, Stakeholders).
- **What are the expected outcomes?** (Agreed action items, process improvements, team feedback).

---

## **2. Gather Data and Insights**
To facilitate a meaningful discussion:
- **Review sprint/project performance** (metrics, velocity, defect rates).
- **Check past action items** (Were previous improvements implemented?).
- **Collect team feedback** (Anonymous surveys, team input, mood tracking).
- **Identify blockers and successes** (Technical, process, communication challenges).

## **3. Choose a Retrospective Format**
| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Start, Stop, Continue** | What should we start doing, stop doing, and continue doing? |
| **Mad, Sad, Glad** | What frustrated us, what disappointed us, and what made us happy? |
| **4Ls (Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For)** | Encourages deeper reflection on the sprint. |
| **Sailboat Exercise** | Identifies winds (helpful factors), anchors (blockers), and islands (goals). |
| **KALM (Keep, Add, Less, More)** | Helps refine processes effectively. |

1. **Introduction (5 min)** ‚Äì Define meeting objectives and rules.
2. **Review Sprint Data (10 min)** ‚Äì Present key metrics and team feedback.
3. **Reflect on What Went Well (15 min)** ‚Äì Celebrate achievements.
4. **Discuss Challenges (15 min)** ‚Äì Identify blockers and process gaps.
5. **Propose Improvements (10 min)** ‚Äì Brainstorm actionable solutions.

- **Assign ownership for follow-ups.**

Example:
| Action Item | Owner | Due Date |
|------------|-------|---------|
| Improve sprint planning accuracy | Scrum Master | MM/DD/YYYY |
| Increase test automation coverage | QA Team | MM/DD/YYYY |
| Reduce review bottlenecks | Dev Lead | MM/DD/YYYY |

- **Check on action item progress** in the next sprint planning session.
- **Encourage team reflection** between retrospectives.

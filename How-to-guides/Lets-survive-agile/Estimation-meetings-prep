# üìù How to Prepare for an Estimation Meeting

## üìå **Objective:**
An **Estimation Meeting** is held to define the effort required for project tasks, ensuring realistic planning and resource allocation. This document outlines how to **prepare for a successful estimation meeting**.

---

## **1. Define the Meeting Goals**
Before the meeting, establish:
- **What needs to be estimated?** (Features, test cases, sprints, releases).
- **Who are the key participants?** (QA, Developers, Product Managers, Business Analysts).
- **What estimation technique will be used?** (Story points, T-shirt sizing, time-based estimation).
- **What are the expected outcomes?** (Agreed-upon estimates, identified risks, assigned owners).

---

## **2. Gather Required Information**
To make the meeting productive:
- **Review project scope and backlog** (Requirement documents, feature specifications).
- **Identify dependencies** (APIs, third-party integrations, environment readiness).
- **Assess historical data** (Past sprint velocity, defect rates, testing complexity).
- **Understand constraints** (Resources, deadlines, compliance requirements).

---

## **3. Choose an Estimation Technique**
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Story Points** | Estimates based on complexity, risk, and effort. |
| **T-Shirt Sizing** | Uses sizes (S, M, L, XL) for rough effort estimation. |
| **Time-Based Estimation** | Assigns estimated hours/days to complete tasks. |
| **Wideband Delphi** | Uses expert consensus for precise estimations. |
| **Function Points** | Measures complexity based on data flow and transactions. |

---

## **4. Prepare Key Questions**
To facilitate discussion, prepare targeted questions such as:

### **For Development Teams:**
- What are the complexities of each task?
- Are there dependencies that could impact estimates?
- How much effort is required for coding, testing, and integration?

### **For QA Teams:**
- What is the expected scope of testing?
- Are automation scripts required or is manual testing sufficient?
- What factors may increase testing effort (data setup, environments, regression scope)?

### **For Product & Business Teams:**
- What is the priority of each feature?
- Are there regulatory or compliance factors to consider?
- What are the key success metrics?

## **5. Structure the Meeting Agenda**
A well-structured agenda ensures clarity and efficiency:

1. **Introduction (5 min)** ‚Äì Define meeting objectives and estimation technique.
2. **Review Scope (10 min)** ‚Äì Discuss features/tasks to be estimated.
3. **Break Down Tasks (15 min)** ‚Äì Identify subtasks and dependencies.
4. **Estimate Effort (20 min)** ‚Äì Assign effort using the chosen technique.
5. **Risk Assessment (10 min)** ‚Äì Identify risks and adjust estimates accordingly.
6. **Next Steps & Assignments (5 min)** ‚Äì Summarize agreements and define action items.

---

## **6. Assign Roles & Responsibilities**
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|--------------|
| **Scrum Master / Project Manager** | Facilitates discussion, ensures process adherence. |
| **Development Lead** | Provides effort estimates for coding and implementation. |
| **QA Lead** | Estimates effort for testing activities. |
| **Business Analyst** | Ensures estimates align with business goals. |
| **Product Owner** | Clarifies priorities and dependencies. |

---

## **7. Capture Notes and Action Items**
- **Document estimated effort for each task.**
- **Track open questions and follow-ups.**
- **Identify action items and assign owners.**

Example:
| Task | Estimated Effort | Owner | Dependencies |
|------|----------------|------|-------------|
| Develop login API | 5 story points | Dev Team | Backend readiness |
| Implement UI validation | 3 story points | Frontend Team | API integration |
| Create automated test suite | 8 story points | QA Team | Test data setup |

---

## **8. Follow-Up After the Meeting**
- **Send a meeting summary** with estimated efforts and task owners.
- **Update sprint backlog or project plan** with final estimates.
- **Schedule follow-up discussions** if needed for refinements.

---

## **Best Practices for a Successful Estimation Meeting**
‚úÖ Break down large tasks into **smaller, manageable pieces** before estimating.  
‚úÖ Use **historical data** from past projects to improve accuracy.  
‚úÖ Ensure **all key stakeholders are present** for better alignment.  
‚úÖ Keep discussions **focused on complexity and effort**, not time pressure.  
‚úÖ Avoid **groupthink**‚Äîencourage independent estimates before discussing.  
‚úÖ Regularly **reassess estimates** as new information emerges.

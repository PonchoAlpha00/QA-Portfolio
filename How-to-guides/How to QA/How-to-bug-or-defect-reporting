# üìù How to Write Bug and Defect Reports

## üìå **Objective:**
A **Bug/Defect Report** documents software issues clearly and concisely to ensure effective debugging and resolution. This guide provides a structured approach to writing high-quality bug reports.

---

## **1. Key Components of a Bug Report**
Each bug report should contain the following essential details:

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bug ID** | Unique identifier for tracking the issue. |
| **Title** | A concise summary of the issue. |
| **Description** | Detailed explanation of the problem, including expected vs. actual results. |
| **Severity** | Defines impact (Critical, High, Medium, Low). |
| **Priority** | Defines urgency (Critical, High, Medium, Low). |
| **Environment** | OS, browser, application version, database, etc. |
| **Preconditions** | Steps or setup required before reproducing the bug. |
| **Steps to Reproduce** | Clear steps to replicate the issue. |
| **Expected Result** | The correct behavior expected from the system. |
| **Actual Result** | The incorrect behavior observed. |
| **Attachments** | Screenshots, logs, or screen recordings. |
| **References** | Jira Story, Test Case ID, Requirement Document. |

## **2. Writing a Clear and Concise Bug Title**
A good bug title should be descriptive but concise.

‚ùå **Bad Title:** ‚ÄúError in login‚Äù  
‚úÖ **Good Title:** ‚ÄúLogin page shows 500 Internal Server Error when submitting valid credentials‚Äù

---

## **3. How to Write an Effective Bug Description**
- Clearly **explain the issue** with relevant context.
- **State the expected behavior** vs. **actual behavior**.
- **Provide additional details** if necessary (e.g., impact, frequency).

Example:
**Description:** When a user submits valid login credentials, the system returns a 500 Internal Server Error instead of redirecting to the dashboard.

---

## **4. Writing Reproducible Steps**
Clear **Steps to Reproduce** help developers replicate the issue efficiently.

### **Example Format:**
| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to the login page | Login page loads correctly |
| 2 | Enter valid credentials and click Login | User is redirected to the dashboard |
| 3 | Observe system response | 500 Internal Server Error appears |

---

## **5. Categorizing Bug Severity & Priority**

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | System crash, data loss, or security vulnerability. |
| **High** | Major feature broken, blocking core functionality. |
| **Medium** | Functional issue but with workarounds available. |
| **Low** | Minor UI glitches, typos, or cosmetic issues. |

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** | Needs immediate attention and fix. |
| **High** | Should be fixed in the current sprint/release. |
| **Medium** | Can be scheduled for a future release. |
| **Low** | Fix if time permits, does not impact functionality. |
